# Figma Keyword Replacer (Substring)

For some reason, Figma string variables cannot be used within a larger string. This plugin enables it.

By default, this plugin detects words that start with the `@` character and looks at it from a collection of the user's choice (by default, a collection named "Keywords") and replaces it with the corresponding value.
